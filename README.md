# concrete-strength-prediction
- Project: Based on [Keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/) deep learning for concrete strength prediction, used three models with different parameters. 
  - Model 1: original data, one hidden layer, 10 nodes
  - Model 2: normalized data, one hidden layer, 10 nodes
  - Model 3: normalized data, three hidden layers, 10 nodes
